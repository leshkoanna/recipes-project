<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tamago gohan (literally "egg rice")—rice mixed with a raw egg—is Japanese comfort food at its simplest. It's one of
    my favorite recipes of all time, and something that can be made in minutes. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>rice</li>
    <li>egg</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>soy sause</li>
    <li>MSG</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place rice in a bowl and make a shallow indentation in the center. Break the whole egg into the center. Season
        with 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon mirin (if using), a pinch of salt, a pinch of MSG (if using), and a
        pinch of Hondashi (if using).
    </li>
    <li> Stir vigorously with chopsticks to incorporate egg; it should become pale yellow, frothy, and fluffy in
        texture. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle with furikake and nori (if using), make a small indentation in the top, and add the other egg yolk (if
        using). Serve immediately.
    </li>
