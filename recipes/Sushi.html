<h1>Sushi</h1>
<img src="sushi.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade
    sushi wins:
    You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would
    cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>rice</li>
    <li>fish</li>
    <li>seaweed</li>
    <li>vegetables</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice, and flatten gently with a rice paddle (but do not smash
        the rice, as my mom would always say):
    </li>
    <li> Place your desired ingredients onto the rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese.</li>
    <li>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat.</li>
</ol>
